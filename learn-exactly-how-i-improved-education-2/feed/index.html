&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(119, 119, 119);&quot;&gt;A lot of people have their big dreams and get knocked down and don’t have things go their way. And you never give up hope, and you really just hold on to it. Hard work and perserverance. You just keep getting up and getting up, and then you get that breakthrough.&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(119, 119, 119);&quot;&gt;Work hard for what you want because it won’t come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>
