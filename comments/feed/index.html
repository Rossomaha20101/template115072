&lt;span&gt;Work hard for what you want because it won\’t come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>

&lt;span&gt;You can decide what you are going to think in any given situation. Your thoughts and feelings determine your actions and determine the results you get. It all starts with your thoughts – and I have found that inspirational words are a quick way to retune your thinking&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>

&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(119, 119, 119);&quot;&gt;A lot of people have their big dreams and get knocked down and don’t have things go their way. And you never give up hope, and you really just hold on to it. Hard work and perserverance. You just keep getting up and getting up, and then you get that breakthrough.&lt;/span&gt;]]></description>
